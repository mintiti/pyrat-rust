"""PyRat game helper types.

This module provides convenience types for working with the PyRat game engine.
The main game interface is now `PyRat` from `pyrat_engine.core`.

Types:
    - MoveUndo: Wrapper for undo information with convenient property access
    - GameResult: Named tuple for step() results (optional convenience type)
