"""Greedy AI - Moves toward the cheese that can be reached fastest.

This AI uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the cheese that takes the minimum
number of turns to reach, properly accounting for both walls and mud delays.

For example:
- A cheese 3 moves away through normal passages takes 3 turns
- A cheese 2 moves away but through 3-turn mud takes 4 turns total
- The AI will choose the first option as it's faster

This AI demonstrates:
- Proper pathfinding that accounts for walls AND mud
- Using utility functions from pyrat_base.utils
- Optimal decision making based on actual time cost
